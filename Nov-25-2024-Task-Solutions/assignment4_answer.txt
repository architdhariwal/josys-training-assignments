Unit Testing is a software testing method where individual components are tested in isolation to verify they work as intended. A unit test checks a single, specific piece of functionality.

Why we write unit tests:

-To catch bugs early in development when they're easier and cheaper to fix
-To validate that code changes don't break existing functionality (regression testing)
-To serve as documentation for how code should behave

Who writes unit tests:
Typically, developers themselves write unit tests for their own code as part of the development process. This is considered a best practice in modern software development because:

-Developers best understand the intended functionality of their code
-It promotes test-driven development (TDD) where tests are written before code
-It makes developers think about edge cases and potential issues while coding
