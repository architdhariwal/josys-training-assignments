## Assignments Overview

This project contains multiple assignments that cover a variety of React concepts such as Context API, Higher Order Components (HOC), Custom Hooks, and Lifecycle Methods.

### Assignment 1: Context API Example

This assignment demonstrates the usage of the Context API for state management in React.

**Files Involved:**
- `src/App.tsx`: Main file where context is provided and consumed.
- `src/components/Child.tsx`: Child component that consumes context.
- `src/components/GrandChild.tsx`: Grandchild component that also consumes context.

### Assignment 2: Higher Order Component (HOC) - Grid Example

This assignment shows how to use a Higher Order Component (HOC) to enhance a component's functionality.

**Files Involved:**
- `src/App.tsx`: Main file that renders the grid and user list.
- `src/components/componentHOC.tsx`: HOC that enhances components.
- `src/components/UserList.tsx`: Component displaying the user list.
- `src/components/DataGridExample.tsx`: Data grid example component using HOC.

### Assignment 3: Storage and User Profile

This assignment demonstrates the use of custom hooks and local storage to persist user profile information.

**Files Involved:**
- `src/App.tsx`: Main file that utilizes the custom hook.
- `src/customHook/useStorage.ts`: Custom hook for managing and interacting with local storage.
- `src/components/StorageDemo.tsx`: Component that handles user profile and storage logic.

### Assignment 4: Lifecycle Methods Demo

This assignment demonstrates the use of React lifecycle methods (i.e., `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`).

**Files Involved:**
- `src/App.tsx`: Main file that renders the lifecycle demo component.
- `src/components/LifecycleDemo.tsx`: Component showcasing lifecycle methods in action.

## Notes

Short notes for each assignment are stored in `.txt` files adjacent to the React app for easy reference.
